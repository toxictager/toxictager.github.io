# My Second Post

**Published on August 10, 2025**

Welcome to day 2 of my blog!

Today, instead of starting my proper cybersecurity/ethical hacking learnings, I decided to finish (to an extent) an unreleased project of mine... **Jarvis!**

As you can imagine, I took inspiration from the famous Tony Stark and decided to create a personal assistant in Python. So far, it can use either a Groq API for better responses or an Ollama model for when I'm offline.

### Its features so far let me:###
- Traverse my file system
- Add, delete, and move files and directories
- Understand natural language
- Accept voice input and talk back
- And more!

#### The features I'm currently working on are:####
- Letting it open apps on my PC
- Allowing me to talk to it like a true assistant, not just issuing commands

#### Some future features I want it to have include: ####
- Searching stuff on the internet
- Doing advanced tasks like coding a bit
- Having a sense of humor, etc.

I plan to have the app-opening feature finished by day 5 of this blog and improve its speech capabilities. Then, by day 6, I can finally start the true journey toward becoming an ethical hacker!
