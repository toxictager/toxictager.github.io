I’m done!!! 🎉 Finally, I’m satisfied enough with my **Jarvis project** to put it aside and officially start my **ethical hacking journey** 🔐💻.

I even had AI build me a **custom roadmap website** just for me, and I’ve started following it step by step.

## What I Did Today 🛠️

- Set up a **VirtualBox VM** running **Kali Linux** 🐉
    
- Went through [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)’s command line course to sharpen my shell skills 💻
    

> Tbh, most of it I already knew, but I still learned some new stuff 😁

✨ This is just the beginning, but I’m super hyped to dive deeper!
