# My Fifth Post! 🚀

_Published August 23, 2025_

I've been following my roadmap, which had me watch a [9-hour long networking video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQR5rTSshw&feature=youtu.be) 📺 — so I was watching that whenever I was free these past 4 days.

**Now I'm ready for the next step!** 💪

## Next Up: Python Mastery 🐍

Time to dive into [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) — just want to make sure my Python skills are **solid enough** for what's coming next!

**Let's go!** ⚡

_P.S. - 9 hours of networking content was intense but totally worth it! My brain is buzzing with new knowledge_ 🧠✨
