# Week 1: Why I'm Starting Over

**November 29, 2024** | Week 1 of 26

---

## The Truth

I've been lying. Not intentionally, but effectively.

For months, I built a portfolio of "cybersecurity tools" - reconnaissance frameworks, automation scripts, impressive-looking projects with clean READMEs. I showed them off. Added them to my GitHub. Linked them on my site.

The problem? I built them all with AI.

I couldn't explain a single line of code. I couldn't debug an error. If someone asked me to modify anything, I'd be exposed immediately.

I was one technical interview away from complete humiliation.

## How It Started

I discovered red team cybersecurity through YouTube. The idea of breaking into systems, finding vulnerabilities, taking control - it fascinated me. I wanted that satisfaction.

So I started building. Except I wasn't really building - I was *prompting*. "Make me a subdomain scanner." "Create a port enumeration tool." "Build a recon framework."

AI would generate the code. I'd copy-paste it. Push to GitHub. Call it my project.

It felt productive. It looked impressive. But I wasn't learning anything.

## The Wake-Up Call

I'm 19. I graduate in May 2026 and start university studying cybersecurity. That's 24 weeks away.

I realized: I'm about to start a computer science program, and I can't actually code.

More importantly, I was building my entire career on a foundation of lies. What happens when I get my first job and can't deliver? When someone asks me to explain my "projects"? When I need to actually *solve a problem* instead of just prompting AI?

I had two options:

1. **Keep faking it** - maintain the facade until it collapses
2. **Start over** - admit the truth and actually learn

I chose to start over.

## What I'm Doing

As of today, I've archived all my AI-generated projects. This site is now honest about where I am: **I'm a beginner learning from scratch.**

Here's my commitment for the next 6 months:

- **10 hours per week** of actual coding (1 hour daily + 2.5 hours weekends)
- **No AI code generation** for at least 3 months - only explanations and debugging
- **Weekly blog posts** every Friday documenting what I learned
- **Public accountability** - this entire journey is documented openly

## The Plan

**Months 1-2:** Python fundamentals through CS50P. Variables, loops, functions, data structures. The boring basics.

**Months 3-4:** Real projects that solve my actual problems. Small, simple, functional.

**Months 5-6:** Security fundamentals - CTFs, Linux basics, understanding how systems work.

**Goal:** Start university in May 2026 as someone who can actually code.

## What I'm Learning This Week

I started CS50P Week 0 today. Basic Python syntax, variables, print statements. It's embarrassingly simple compared to my "impressive" portfolio.

But this time, I'm writing every line myself. When I get an error, I'm reading it and figuring it out. When I don't understand something, I'm looking it up instead of asking AI to fix it.

It's slower. It's frustrating. But I'm actually learning.

## Why I'm Being Public

Three reasons:

1. **Accountability** - It's harder to quit when people are watching
2. **Community** - I'm not the only one doing this
3. **Honesty** - The tech industry has enough fakers

If you're in the same boat - if you've been using AI as a crutch instead of a tool - let's change that together.

## What Scares Me

I'm afraid I'll fall back to AI when things get hard. That I'll take the easy way out. That I'll realize I'm not cut out for this.

But I'm more afraid of showing up to university unprepared. Of being exposed as a fraud in my first job. Of wasting my potential because I was too lazy to do the work.

So here we go. Week 1 of 26.

No shortcuts this time.

**Next week:** CS50P progress and my first real Python script (written entirely by me).

**Follow along:** Updates every Friday.
