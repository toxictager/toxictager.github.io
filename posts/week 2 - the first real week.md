# Week 2: First Real Week, 4.5 Hours
**December 6, 2025** | Week 2 of 26

---

This week was my first proper week yet I only managed to do about 4.5 hours (including this post!) but for my first week - I'm fine with that. I'm still learning my pace and how to integrate this learning with real life responsibilities.

## What I Did

### **Monday (Dec 2):**
- Watched CS50P Week 1 lecture (1 hour)
- Learned: conditionals, if/elif/else, or/and, modulo
- Notes: comparison operators, match statement

### **Tuesday (Dec 3):**
- Deep Thought problem (5 min)
- Home Federal Savings Bank (20 min)
- Learned: `.startswith()`, `in` operator
- Total: 0.5 hours

### **Wednesday (Dec 4):**
- File Extensions (10 min)
- Math Interpreter (35 min)
- Learned: `.endswith()`, `.split()`, variable unpacking
- Total: 1 hour

### **Thursday (Dec 5):**
- Meal Time (20 min)
- Learned: functions with return values, passing data between functions
- Struggled with: understanding how variables "get across" functions
- Total: 0.33 hours

### **Friday (Dec 6):**
- School + donated blood + family dinner
- Writing this blog post (1.5 hours)
- Total: 1.5 hours

## What I Learned

- Problems may take more or less time than planned (main reason I didn't hit my goal this week)
- Need weekly project to complete the 10 hour goal
- Fridays are unpredictable with school and life

## What Went Wrong

- Didn't hit the 10 hour goal of coding
- No weekly project completed
- Friday was a waste but for valid reason

## What's Next

- Adding a weekly project to each week
- Try to get more hours in on days that aren't so busy
- Front-load work earlier in the week (Mon-Thu)
