# My First Post: The Journey Begins

**Published on: August 8, 2025**

Welcome to the first entry in my ethical hacking journal! I've created this blog to document everything I learnâ€”from fundamental concepts and tool configurations to my experiences with Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and personal projects.

This will be a space for raw notes, structured tutorials, and reflections on the cybersecurity landscape. My first goal is to master network reconnaissance.

### What I'm learning:
* Network scanning with Nmap
* Directory brute-forcing
* Subdomain enumeration

Here's an example of a code block:
```bash
# Example of a simple nmap scan
nmap -sV --script=default 127.0.0.1
