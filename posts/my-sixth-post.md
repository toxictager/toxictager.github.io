# My Sixth Post! 🎉

_Posted on August 24, 2025_

Today I finished **Phase 1: Foundations** by reading the first 6 chapters of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and learned a few simple [Git commands](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)! 📚✨

Tomorrow I start on **Phase 2** — working inside the Kali VM I built to master nmap! 🐧🔍

### YAY! 🚀
