                <h2>The Real Story</h2>
                <p>I'm Loui, 19 years old, in my final year of secondary school in Bulgaria. In May 2026, I'll be starting university at Veliko Tarnovo studying cybersecurity.</p>
                
                <p>But here's the truth: I'm not a developer yet. I'm learning to become one.</p>

                <h3>How I Got Here</h3>
                <p>I discovered red team cybersecurity through a YouTube video. The idea of breaking into systems, finding vulnerabilities, taking control - it fascinated me. I wanted that satisfaction of solving the puzzle, of outsmarting the system.</p>

                <p>So I built a portfolio. Impressive-looking projects. "Recon tools," "security frameworks," all hosted on GitHub with nice READMEs. There was just one problem: I built them all with AI.</p>

                <p>I couldn't explain how any of them worked. I couldn't debug a single error. If someone had asked me to modify one line of code, I would've been exposed immediately.</p>

                <h3>The Wake-Up Call</h3>
                <p>I realized I was one technical interview away from complete humiliation. More importantly, I was going to start university in a few months completely unprepared. I had to make a choice:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keep faking it</strong> and fail when it mattered</li>
                    <li><strong>Start over</strong> and actually learn to code</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I chose to start over.</p>

                <h3>What I'm Doing Now</h3>
                <p>I archived all my AI-generated projects. I'm starting from absolute fundamentals - variables, loops, functions, the boring stuff that actually matters. I'm committing to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>10 hours per week</strong> of actual coding (1 hour daily + 2.5 hours on weekends)</li>
                    <li><strong>No AI code generation</strong> for at least 3 months - only explanations and debugging help</li>
                    <li><strong>Weekly blog posts</strong> every Friday documenting what I learned and struggled with</li>
                    <li><strong>Public accountability</strong> - this entire journey is documented openly</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Plan</h3>
                <p><strong>Months 1-2:</strong> Python fundamentals through CS50P. Build simple CLI tools that solve my own problems.</p>

                <p><strong>Months 3-4:</strong> Real projects - password generator, file organizer, web scrapers. Document everything I learn.</p>

                <p><strong>Months 5-6:</strong> Security fundamentals - PicoCTF, OverTheWire Bandit, understanding how systems actually work.</p>

                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Start university in May 2026 as someone who can actually code, not just prompt AI.</p>

                <h3>Why I'm Being Public About This</h3>
                <p>Three reasons:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Accountability</strong> - It's harder to quit when people are watching</li>
                    <li><strong>Community</strong> - I'm not the only one doing this, and maybe others will join me</li>
                    <li><strong>Honesty</strong> - The tech industry has enough people faking it. I'd rather be real.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What Scares Me</h3>
                <p>I'm afraid I'll fall back to AI. That when things get hard, I'll take the easy way out. That I'll give up when the fundamentals get boring. That I'll realize I'm not cut out for this.</p>

                <p>But I'm more afraid of showing up to university unprepared. Of getting my first job and being exposed as a fraud. Of wasting my potential because I was too lazy to do the work.</p>

                <h3>The Dream</h3>
                <p>Five years from now, I want to be finishing university with a cybersecurity degree and starting a real job in red team security. I want to work remotely, eventually from Japan. But more than that, I want to actually deserve the job I get.</p>

                <p>That's why I'm doing this.</p>
