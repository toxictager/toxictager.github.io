# Week X: [Title of Your Post]

**[Date]** | Week X of 26

---

## What I Learned This Week

[Write about the concepts, skills, or insights you gained. Be specific - not "I learned Python" but "I learned how dictionaries work and why they're faster than lists for lookups"]

Examples:
- Learned how to use for loops to iterate through lists
- Understood the difference between parameters and arguments
- Discovered why my code was breaking (forgot to convert input to int)

---

## What I Struggled With

[BE HONEST. This is the most valuable part. What confused you? What took hours to figure out? What still doesn't make sense?]

Examples:
- Spent 3 hours debugging a syntax error (missing colon after if statement)
- Still don't fully understand list comprehensions
- Got frustrated with CS50P Problem Set 2 - took way longer than expected

---

## What I Built

[Any code you wrote this week, even if it's simple. Include a brief description or code snippet]

Examples:
- Built a simple calculator that handles +, -, *, / operations
- Created a script that organizes files by extension
- Solved 3 CS50P problem sets

**Code snippet (optional):**
```python
# Simple example of what you built
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Wins & Breakthroughs

[Moments where things clicked. Even small wins count!]

Examples:
- Finally understood how functions return values
- Got my first program to run without errors on the first try
- Someone in r/learnprogramming helped me fix a bug I'd been stuck on for hours

---

## Mistakes & Lessons

[What went wrong and what you learned from it]

Examples:
- Used = instead of == in an if statement - learned the difference between assignment and comparison
- Forgot to save my file before running it - wasted 20 minutes debugging "old" code
- Tried to learn too many things at once - realized I need to focus on one concept at a time

- YouTube video by Corey Schafer on functions
- Help from u/username on Reddit
